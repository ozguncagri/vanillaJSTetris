# Vanilla JS Tetris

It started as a challenge for me to develop games and it was really fun to develop it. It is also base for game logic for me to develop other version with other languages and other engines.

# Requirements to run this game

- Any static file server

	Server is required for saving high scores to local storage. Opening file directly in web browser will end with security error for accessing local storage.

- Modern web browser that can handle;
	- HTML5
	- ES6
	- Local Storage
	- Canvas Elements
